My Plan:
I'm creating a web app that works like a community forum where people can post notices about events. There will also be a section dedicated to ads and related topics. The idea is to make it easier for people to find information about local things like shops, services, 
or sports facilities without having to search all over the place. It’ll be easy to access, and people can use it anytime as long as they’re logged in.

The Problem I'm Solving:
Right now, there isn’t a dedicated online space where people in a community can come together to share updates, ask questions, or organize local events. I'm aiming to fix that by giving people a simple way to communicate and stay informed about what’s going on in their area.

The Main Goal: 
The main goal of this app is to help people stay connected online within a specific community. Using bulletin-style posts, residents can share updates or useful info directly with each other. It also makes it easier to organize bigger events like sports days or local markets by giving everyone a clear place to find updates.

Who It's For: 
The app is designed for anyone living in the community, regardless of age or background. It’s also helpful for visitors who might be looking for things to do, places to go, or want to ask locals for recommendations.
